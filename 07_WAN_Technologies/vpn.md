# VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)

## What is a VPN?
A VPN creates a secure, encrypted "tunnel" over an untrusted public network (like the internet) to connect private networks or remote users. This allows data to be transmitted securely as if it were on a private network.

## Key VPN Concepts
- **Tunneling:** The process of encapsulating a private packet inside a public packet.
- **Encryption:** Secures the data so it cannot be read if intercepted.
- **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of the users or devices on both ends of the tunnel.

## Common Types of VPNs
1.  **Site-to-Site VPN:** Connects an entire office or private network to another office or private network. All devices on both networks can communicate as if they were on the same network.
2.  **Remote Access VPN:** Allows an individual user (e.g., a remote employee) to connect securely to their company's private network. The user's device acts as an endpoint for the VPN tunnel.

## Technologies Used for VPNs
- **IPsec:** A suite of protocols used to secure IP communication. It provides both authentication and encryption.
- **SSL/TLS:** Used by many remote-access VPNs. It's the same technology used to secure HTTPS web traffic.

## Note
CCNA focuses on understanding the concepts and general use cases of VPNs. Detailed configuration is typically covered in more advanced certifications like CCNP Security.
