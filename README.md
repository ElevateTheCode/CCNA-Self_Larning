# 📘 CCNA-Networking-Study

A complete self-learning guide for the **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** certification.  
This project is organized in a structured, beginner-friendly way to help you master core networking topics through notes, labs, and real-world examples.

---

## 🧭 Who This Is For

- Students preparing for the **CCNA 200-301** exam  
- Beginners learning **Networking Fundamentals**  
- Aspiring **Network Engineers**, **NOC Technicians**, or **Cybersecurity Analysts**  
- Anyone who wants a structured, practical, hands-on CCNA learning experience

---

## 📚 What You Will Learn

- OSI & TCP/IP networking models
- IP addressing, Subnetting (CIDR, VLSM)
- Routing & Switching (Static, OSPF, VLAN, STP)
- IP services like DHCP, NAT, DNS
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- WAN technologies (PPP, MPLS, VPN)
- Device hardening & Network Security basics
- Practical labs using Packet Tracer, GNS3, EVE-NG
